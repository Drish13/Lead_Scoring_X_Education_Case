# Lead_Scoring_X_Education_Case
This project has a classification model built to score the leads for better conversion rate in the future. 
X Education is an online learning platform which generate leads from multiple sources like Search engines, phones calls, social media, chatbots etc. 
Once the leads are into the system, they work on making them susbscribed to the platform, which we say as conversion. Currently the platform has conversion rate of around 35-40% and CEO wants to improve this rate by targeting the best leads first to get the higher conversion and then strategising for the rest of the leads accordingly. 

We are helping in deciding the factors which are impacting the lead to conversion journey, and also scoring the customers which based on their probability to convert, using Logistic Regression Model. Using our model, team can undertsand which variables / factors to be focused more to improve the conversion rate. We are providing set of summary, PPT. and code (.ipynb) file to understand the methodoligy and why we are recommending certain steps to be taken for improving the metric.
